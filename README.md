# ProteinDigester
ProteinDigester is a small tool created to import and digest proteins from FASTA databases. Once digested, it makes it possible to quickly determine which peptides are proteotypic and if not, from which other proteins they can be obtained.
# Quick guide
- Launch ProteinDigester
- Create a digestion database (Ctrl+N)
- Import a FASTA file (Ctrl+I)
- Digest the database with one or more enzymes/missed cleavages (Ctrl+M)

You can add more than one digestion. If you do so, you can select the current digestion using the "Working digestion" menu.

You can search proteins by name, sequence or digest peptides. Once you've found the protein you want, just double-click on it and ProteinDigester will show you all the peptides obtained and wether they are proteotypic or not. If you double-click on a peptide, it will show you from which other proteins it can be obtained.
